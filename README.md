# ShellSimulation

This project aims to create a simulation of a Unix shell using C/C++. The main challenges are twofold: accurately parsing Unix commands and implementing pipelining.

## Usage

- shell_phase3 is the final stage implementation. To run it, `./shell_phase3` and then it shows `osh>`. Type unix command e.g. `cat main.c` or `ls -l > directory_content.txt`
